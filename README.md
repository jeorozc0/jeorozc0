just a dev who loves building stuff and diving deep into systems.

currently vibing with ~
* 📈 building scalable platforms: crafting high-performance systems that actually work
* 🚀 full stack experiments: mixing React, Node, Go, and whatever looks interesting
* 💻 systems programming: learning the low-level magic

tech i enjoy:
`javascript` `go` `react` `node` `typescript` `docker` `postgresql` `supabase`

sometimes i also play with ~
`aws` `express` `postgres` `ai`

ongoing projects ~
* 📝 career deck: job application tracking system in React/Go
* 🛠️ compiler in Go: because why not build one from scratch?
